[33m[1mCMake Warning[0m at /home/pierremoussa/catkin_ws/src/iROS_drone/rotors_simulator/rotors_gazebo_plugins/CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmavlink.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "mavlink", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "mavlink" with any
  of the following names:

    mavlinkConfig.cmake
    mavlink-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "mavlink" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "mavlink_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "mavlink" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.


CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.10/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:911 (if):
  Policy CMP0054 is not set: Only interpret if() arguments as variables or
  keywords when unquoted.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0054" for policy
  details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning.

  Quoted variables like "chrono" will no longer be dereferenced when the
  policy is set to NEW.  Since the policy is not set the OLD behavior will be
  used.
